# hello-world
First tutorial repository

Hi there!
My name is Steven! I am currently working through Udacity's Front-End Web Developer nanodegree. I needed a Github account for it, and I know this account will be very useful even well beyond that.
I like video games, swing dancing, and laughing with my friends.
